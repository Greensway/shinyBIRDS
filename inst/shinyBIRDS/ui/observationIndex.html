<p>This function extracts the proportion of visits (or observations) detecting a focal species to all visits (or observations) over time or space.</p>
<p>It implements the following algorithm to calculate the observation index: <i>OI = log ( (At / (At + Rt) ) / ( A / (A + R) ) ) </i> where At is the sum of observations of a focal species during time t (or gridcell), Rt is sum of observations of all species in reference group during t (or gridcell), A and R are the total sums for observations. If the ratio to log = 0 it adds 0.1 to avoid -Inf results.</p>
