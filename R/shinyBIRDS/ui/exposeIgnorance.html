<p>Ignorance scores are a proxy for the lack of sampling effort, computed by making the number of observations relative to a reference number of observations that is considered to be enough to reduce the ignorance score by half (henceforth the Half-ignorance approach). The algorithm behind the Ignorance Score is designed for comparison of bias and gaps in primary biodiversity data across taxonomy, time and space Read more here: <a href="https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/5361/">Ruete 2015 Biodiv Data J 3:e5361, doi:10.3897/BDJ.3.e5361 </a></p>
