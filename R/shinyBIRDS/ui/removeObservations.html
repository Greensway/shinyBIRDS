<p>This function removes observations based on the visists effort or quality.</p>
<p>Visit effort or quality could be given most often by species list length
(that is, the number of species observed during the visit, SLL). However,
in some cases there could be only one or few species observed but in great
numbers each and spred across a big surveyed area. The effort then may not be
small. If the user may find it necesary to remove those observations belonging
to visits with an effort lower than a threshold, or a certain percentage of
the "worst" observations, then this function will help.</p>
