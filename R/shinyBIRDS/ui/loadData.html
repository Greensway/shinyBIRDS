<p>Upload a csv-file with reported species observations. The csv-file should have at least a column for species name, one or several columns for date of observation, one or several columns for identifying a visit and, coordinate columns. </p>
<p>What a visit should be is not always clearly defined and extractable in a dataset. A reasonable assumption is that a visit could be identified from the records made by one person on a certain day and at a specific location or site.</p>
